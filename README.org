* Jupyter Maps
** Ratinale
*** What
Wrapper over [[https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/][Mapbox GL JS]] which allows you to render maps in Jupyter notebooks. It does not aim to cover full Mapbox GL JS API (which is impossible anyway due to JS callbacks) but provides set of additional functionality and convenience methods.
*** Why
I need to render interactive maps in Jupyter and feed them thousands of GeoJSON polygons with different rendering options and associated popups. All existing solutions do not provide features I need (like Matplotlib) or are extremely slow (like Folium).
** Usage
Just look at example notebooks.
